pycryptol: Use Cryptol with Python
==================================

This package offers deep integration between Python and Cryptol_. Its
goal is to allow a Python program to use all of the features available
at a standalone Cryptol console. Where possible, the bindings attempt
to provide deeper integration so that Cryptol values may be used
transparently as if they were Python values.
